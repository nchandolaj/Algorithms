This github repository contains a list of simple software algorithms implemented in Python.

I am using this repository as a mechanism to 
1. refresh my software development skills, including object-oriented programming and design patterns
2. learn about github functionality such as Project, Issues, Branches, etc.
3. improve my command over Python language

PS: I plan to implement the same algorithms in C++ at a later date.
